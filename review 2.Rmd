We also find Caribean or northern american islands such as which aren;t countries but collectivies or municipalities of countries such as France or Netherlands. ALthough they are not nations, they competed against other countries either in friendly games or in local tournaments.

# When do games occur?
# Interstingly, the very first games mostly occur on Saturdays but a decent number also took place on Mondays! No game occurred on a Sunday until 1900, potentially for religious purposes but, around the 1910's Sunday was the most common day of the week to see an international game. Other week days, from Tuesday to Friday, weren't an option until later (as late as 1910 for Fridays).
# 
# The proportion of games happenning on a given day then changed quite a lot. Wednesdays games became very common and around 30% of the games happened on this day around the year 2000. More recently days such as Tuesday, Thursday or Friday also became more popular.

# * A victory of the home-based team has always been the most likely event.
# * A victory of the visitors is the second most likely outcome, although it tends to decrease in the second half of the 20th century.
# * A draw has always been the least likely outcome, altough it has increased in share since the 1940's.

# 
# * Scotland once, was one of the top scoring nations (OK, that was when max 10 teams were competing, but still) and slowly dropped from the top 6.
# * Sweden was consistently in the top 6 for 4 decades in a row (1910s to 1940s).
# * Fiji and Tahiti were at the top of the charts during some decades too, including some recent ones.
# * Zambia and China once were among the top scorers.
# * During the last 3 decades, Germany and Spain are the only major nations who made it twice to the top 6.

In comparison, the Americas, generally show a more homogeneous distribution.
# Oceania has apparently a high win rate but there are mostly small teams competing between each others (Australia is part of the AFC, i.e. Asia).

# # Bonus track:  Evolution of intercontinental games

# Earlier, we saw how different teams and continent start to engage in international games. However, teams tend to start playing against their neighbours. So, when did inter-continental games start and, by extension, soccer became an intercontinental game.
# 
# Games are considered as intercontinental if they oppose two teams from different associations (e.g AFC and UEFA). Australia is part of the AFC but was relocated to Oceania for this analysis. The American continent is the union of the CONMEBOL and CONCACAF associations. 

# We add some features to our data frame so that we can know whether a game is intercontinental.

# The first intercontinental game occurred in 1888 and opposed Scotland to Canada (4-0), 16 years after the very first international game. Notably, Scotland was already involved in the first international game. The next two other intercontinental games happened way later, in 1916 when, in the span of two weeks, the USA played against Sweden and Norway. Between the 1920's and 1940's, intercontinental games became more regular though still sparse (some years didn't count any).
# The end of WWII will mark the beginning of global soccer as, since 1946, there were at least one intercontinental game per year. The percentage of intercontinental game kept increasing until the 1990's, when, in average, about 15% of the games opposed teams of different continent.
# Since then, there ha been a slight decrease of intercontinental games.
# 
# There are some visible peaks of interncontinental games which coincide with World Cup years. This makes sense as, by design, teams will face teams of other continents and also take profit of pre-competition friendly games to gauge their level against a wide range of teams from different continents.

# Oceania has been the continent most often involved in intercontinental games. In the early years it is due to many games being organised between New Zealand, Australia, India. Canada and South Africa, all Commonwealth countries. In the latest years, this likely due to the fact that Australia is affiliated to the AFC and then plays qualification rounds against Asian teams.
# Europe has for a long time being the continent the least involved in intercontinental games, this is consistent with this continent hosting most of the oldest soccer teams.
# Africa was initially involved in many intercontinental games but is now the continent whose teams travel the least.
# Americ and Asia have similar trajectories: they used to play many games against teams from other continents but now are playing much more often against "local" opponents.
